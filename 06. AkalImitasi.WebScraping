Although the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) factor calculation method provides reliable values, this method analyzes sections and defects individually and indicates current maintenance needs, but it cannot be used to predict the occurrence of new defects. Therefore, it is necessary to complement this method by considering variables that influence the occurrence of faults, among which are the geospatial distribution and the specific characteristics of the slabs. This research focuses on the identification of multiple types of disturbances that exist in Portland Cement Pavements (PCC), located in a high traffic area in the city of Valdivia (Chile). A spatial geostatistical relationship is established through visual inspection using geographical maps, as well as distribution, using the kriging method. This technique makes use of variograms that allow quantifying the parameters used in this study, thus expressing the spatial autocorrelation of the faults analyzed. From the results obtained by spatial geostatistics and kriging, it is possible to generate a data correlation for the distribution and characteristics of the streets considered. In addition, a co-kriging method is established instead of an ordinary kriging method. The relationship between observed and predicted values improved from 0.3327 to 0.5770. The width of the slabs, as well as some streets, is shown in our analysis to be unimportant. For better model accuracy, the number of covariates associated with the type of vehicle traffic, the age and shape of the slabs, and the construction techniques used for the pavement needs to increase.\n","Full Text: Today, roads have gone from being rudimentary paths to modern streets and highways, conceived not only for foot traffic but also for motor vehicle transportation on a large scale [1,2]. The distresses present in highways, roads, and streets are directly related to the comfort and security of the users, who could be subjected to a traffic accident at any moment [3,4]. Consequently, there is a need to identify the distresses caused by the different parameters affecting roadways, with the goal of getting to the core of the problem and find a solution [5]. To this effect, relying on a method of evaluating the state of the pavement and the distresses presented therein is indispensable to an efficient identification of mitigation measures [6]. To carry out this analysis, according to the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method indicated in the ASTM D6433-18 [7], visual inspections and measurements of distresses are made on the existing pavements, both flexible and rigid, generating a factor through which the priorities of action are established according to the severity of the damages observed in the different sections of the analyzed areas. The main values measured are related to the length, width, and depth of the crack or deterioration. However, the analysis carried out evaluates these zones individually, without considering the defects of nearby areas or the relationship between the types of defects and their distribution, to more accurately predict the future appearance of new damages in the same zone or nearby areas.\n","Gubler et al. published a study, focused on the analysis of the main urban roads in the USA, to find a strategy that could minimize the accumulated damage of the roads, since 28% of the pavements are in poor or deficient condition [8]. The unintended consequence of this decision for road users was an increased maintenance cost of their vehicles and the increased risk of traffic accidents. Roads in critical condition represent 53% of the total distance driven annually in the USA, making the evaluation of the dimensions of these pavement distresses paramount. The organization that carried out this study—TRIP—promotes transport policies that aid in alleviating traffic congestion and its impact on air quality, improving the conditions of roadway infrastructure, building safer roads, and bettering economic productivity [9].\n","The current situation in Chile is not very different from that in the USA. Chile has an approximate road network of 82,133.78 km, of which 40% is paved. However, the quality of the Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement is not always adequate, due to the lack of maintenance and inspection and, in some cases, poor techniques used in construction [9]. Valdivia is a city located in the Chilean South macro-zone, where it is common to find pavements in poor condition, with potholes and cracks, especially in the city center, where there is a greater volume of traffic. It is important to identify the areas where the most distresses concentrate and to link their origin with local characteristics, thus seeking a mathematical relationship with the distresses in the adjacent slabs to predict their distribution and nature [10]. In so doing, preventive measures could be taken in a timely fashion, at the least minimizing the damages and extending the life of the pavements [11].\n","Other types of studies focusing on the optimization of the geometry of the slab have been carried out to reduce the thickness of the slab, minimize the devices of the mechanical transfer, and minimize the damage produced. In a theoretical study, Roesler, Cervantes, and Amirkhanian showed, through academic research, that a thinner size reduces load and induced tensile stresses, for large-scale testing [12].\n","In 2013, a study was published focusing on the revision of the methods used for predicting the performance of pavements (rigid and flexible), searching for solutions prior to breakage. Simulations were made from the data obtained on the pavement built on Route 50 in Ohio (USA). It was determined that the long-term performance of a pavement can be calculated from a small fraction of its design life and a set of purely statistical/empirical algorithms. However, the research mentions that the test pavement fails due to transverse cracking, and the progression of the crack does not depend on the type of sealing treatment used [13].\n","A more recent study has also used Bayesian modeling to identify the most influential variables and to quantify the uncertainty of linear regression models predicting the occurrence of deformation in flexible pavement structures [14]. It was possible to establish the variables with the most significant variability and those with the greatest uncertainty by using the best models developed in conjunction with the Bayesian technique. Therefore, the Bayesian model could also be used for rigid pavements when detailed information is available on the properties and conditions of the rigid pavements to be analyzed.\n","Urban road pavements can be classified through high-resolution spatial images, thus seeking options to help solve the progressive deterioration caused by increased vehicle traffic. Majore et al. conducted a study based on the use of orthoimages generated by geographical institutes with the intention of mapping roads in the Czech Republic that needed restoration. Characterization was done by observing the orthoimages and creating “interpretation keys” related to the class or type of road and its characteristics. The result provided the resources to supply, quickly and accurately, information on roads in poor condition [15].\n","As can be seen from the analysis of the state of the art, ASTM D6433 is used to assess the need for maintenance of pavement sections. Although the PCI factor calculation method provides reliable values, this method analyzes sections and defects individually and indicates current maintenance needs, but it cannot be used to predict the occurrence of new defects.\n","This research helps to simplify the analysis of pavement defects in large areas, where automated means are not available. The analysis focuses on identifying the main types of distresses present in the PCC pavements in the center of Valdivia (Chile) and the relation between them, using the Instructive for visual inspection of paved roads (National Directorate of Roads of Chile 2013), based on AASHTO-93 [16] and ASTM D6433-18 [7], and considering the characteristics and dimensions of the slabs and their distresses. The autocorrelation of defects will be estimated through kriging analysis, allowing for the interpolation of distresses beyond the sample slabs; in turn, this procedure will help analyze the relationship between the faults observed in different sections and estimate the best way to develop successive construction and repair processes of pavements.\n","The method used allows to establish the relationship in the occurrence of pavement defects from the geospatial distribution of the streets and, at the same time, adds variables specific to each of the streets.\n","\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"/v2/external/notebooks/empty.ipynb","timestamp":1743108651437}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
